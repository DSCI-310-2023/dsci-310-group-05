* Any unethical or unprofessional conduct.

Participants who work in this project have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. This also applies to other contributions that they consider to be inappropriate, offensive, or harmful.

Adopting this  Code of Conduct means that any participant of this team will fully commit themselves to apply these principles in every aspect of this project. In any instance of violation of these values, the team will take the necessary steps that are outlined in the consequences section below.

## Consequences

If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the following steps will be taken:

* All members of the team will have a meeting and openly talk about how this behaviour is negatively influencing the team and the community.  
* The participant who engaged in this behaviour will be warned informally. 
* If this behaviour continues the Teaching Assistants and the professor will be contacted and the participant will be warned again.
* If the participant keeps engaging in this behaviour the group will contact the professor again and request the removal of that participant from the team.
