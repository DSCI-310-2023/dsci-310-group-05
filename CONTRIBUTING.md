# Contributing to the project "Cannabis Use Prediction"

ðŸ¥³ Thank you for taking the time to contribute! ðŸ¥°

We welcome contributions from anyone who is interested in improving the project. Please use your best judgment, and feel free to propose any changes you deem appropriate in a pull request.

## About the project
### Purpose and scope:

The purpose of the Cannabis Use Prediction project is to explore and analyze the relationship between demographic patterns, personality traits, and prior nicotine use, and their potential to predict cannabis use. The project aims to use machine learning techniques to make predictions based on respondents' data on drug usage, personality, and demographics.

By conducting this analysis, the project hopes to gain insights into the potential factors that influence an individual's cannabis use, and to provide a basis for further research in this area. The project may also have practical applications, such as helping to identify individuals who are at higher risk of developing cannabis use disorders and to inform the development of targeted interventions for these individuals.

### Data:

We use the drug consumption dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository to conduct our analysis. The dataset is a survey collected between 2011 to 2012 of 1885 respondents questioned about their usage of 18 drugs. The survey also collected information about their personality (NEO-FFI-R, BIS-11, ImpSS) and demographics (level of education, age, country of residence, ethnicity, and gender). Make sure you fully explore the data before suggesting any changes to the project.
