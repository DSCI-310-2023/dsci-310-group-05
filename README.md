# Cannabis Use Prediction Project
__Contributors:__ Angela Machado, Dalia Ahmad, Ece Celik, Rithika Nair

### Project Summary ###
This project aims to predict cannabis use based on demographic patterns, personality traits, and nicotine use. A survey collected between 2011 to 2012 of 1885 respondents from the UCI Machine Learning repository was used as the main sample. By using age, gender, education, Big Five personality traits, and nicotine use as predictors, we predicted how likely an individual is to use cannabis. Based on the analysis, we were able to predict an individual's probability of using cannabis with a 79% accuracy rate, using a 5-fold cross-validation and a K-nearest neighbors classification algorithm with 23 neighbors. The findings suggest that the algorithm can be used in the future with a satisfactorily high degree of certainty in regards to its outputs.

### Data Analysis ###

__How to run the analysis:__
The data analysis should be run in the order stipulated in the analysis file, first importing the necessary libraries, performing the data cleaning and wrangling, followed by exploratory visualisations and finally the classification algorithm with its associated visualisations.

__Dependencies:__
These are the dependencies needed to run the analysis:
- tidyverse
- tidymodels
- repr
- dplyr
- tidyr

__Licences:__
The license used for this project is the MIT License.

## Teamwork

#### __Group 5 Team Contract__<br/>
__Expectations__<br/>
- Group submission deadline: 24 hours prior to the deadline in the syllabus
- If team members cannot complete their sections or require further help, members should give notice on Slack at least 24 hours before the group submission date to see if work should be redistributed or if the expected time should be increased.
- All submissions are expected to meet the criteria of the milestones as set out in the instructions. This includes making sure all scripts are working, creating tests for all your functions, and using proper grammar in written submissions.
- Clear communication amongst all group members. Do not hesitate to reach out for help if required. Consider all the opinions/ieas brought to discussion.<br/>

__Meetings__ <br/>
Meeting times were established during the initial team meeting held on 2023-01-27. Meetings will be held on Zoom or on campus (if every member in on campus) on the following dates:
- Monday 12:00-1:00pm
- Monday 6:00 - 7:00 pm
- Wednesday 6:00 - 7:00pm
- Friday 9:00 - 10:00am
- Friday 5:00 - 6:00pm
- Saturday 11:00 -12:00pm
- Sunday 11:00 -12:00pm
All members are expected to attend the meetings. If a member cannot make a meeting, written notice must be given either the night before (for morning meetings) or the day of (for evening meetings) the meeting to discuss alternative options.<br/>

__Communication__ <br/>
We will use Slack for communication and Github for submission and reviewing work. In addition, we will use Github to share our ideas and suggestions about the project. Informal communication and scheduling meetings will be done via Slack.<br/>

__Reviews__<br/>
All members must submit a pull request for their work on the repository for the group project on Github.com as many times as necessary for the project milestone. Members are expected to ask teammates to review their work and have work reviewed within 24 hours after creation. <br/>

__Roles__<br/>
These are the following roles so far:
Scribe<br/>
- Responsible for taking notes at the meetings and in-class lab sessions and adding as a GitHub issue.
- Responsible for sharing with all notes and in-class activities to teammates.

Proof-reader<br/>
- Responsible for doing a final check of the submission before the deadline to make sure all requirements are satisfied.

Submission<br/>
- Responsible for submitting the milestones and deliverables on time after the proof-reading.

Positions will be rotated each week to ensure that each team member does each position once.<br/>

__Deadlines__ <br/>
Major deadlines for the whole term will be set up in the initial meetings, and the deadlines for more detailed deliverables will be assigned during meetings.<br/>
On Saturday before submission, the proof-reader is responsible for reviewing the work done in the week and guaranteeing that the final version is accurate. They will also be in charge of creating the required version tag. <br/>

__Breach of Contract__<br/>
Failure to follow the team contract will result in a four-step warning system:
- Discuss the behaviour of the team mate during a meeting, trying to understand what might be causing it and agree on new contract clauses that can improve the group dynamics.
- If the above fails, a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions will be sent.
- The third step is to set up an official meeting with the team mate to discuss the behaviour and write an agreement to follow the team contract.
- Lastly, if no other measures work, we will reach out to the lab instructor or TAs of the issues with the team mate.<br/>
